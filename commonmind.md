### 常用注解

| Annotation               | Description                                                  |
| :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@Test`                  | Denotes that a method is a test method. Unlike JUnit 4’s `@Test` annotation, this annotation does not declare any attributes, since test extensions in JUnit Jupiter operate based on their own dedicated annotations. Such methods are *inherited* unless they are *overridden*. |
| `@ParameterizedTest`     | Denotes that a method is a [parameterized test](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-parameterized-tests). Such methods are *inherited* unless they are *overridden*. |
| `@RepeatedTest`          | Denotes that a method is a test template for a [repeated test](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-repeated-tests). Such methods are *inherited* unless they are *overridden*. |
| `@TestFactory`           | Denotes that a method is a test factory for [dynamic tests](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-dynamic-tests). Such methods are *inherited* unless they are *overridden*. |
| `@TestTemplate`          | Denotes that a method is a [template for test cases](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-test-templates) designed to be invoked multiple times depending on the number of invocation contexts returned by the registered [providers](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#extensions-test-templates). Such methods are *inherited* unless they are *overridden*. |
| `@TestMethodOrder`       | Used to configure the [test method execution order](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-test-execution-order) for the annotated test class; similar to JUnit 4’s `@FixMethodOrder`. Such annotations are *inherited*. |
| `@TestInstance`          | Used to configure the [test instance lifecycle](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-test-instance-lifecycle) for the annotated test class. Such annotations are *inherited*. |
| `@DisplayName`           | Declares a custom [display name](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-display-names) for the test class or test method. Such annotations are not *inherited*. |
| `@DisplayNameGeneration` | Declares a custom [display name generator](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-display-name-generator) for the test class. Such annotations are *inherited*. |
| `@BeforeEach`            | Denotes that the annotated method should be executed *before* **each** `@Test`, `@RepeatedTest`, `@ParameterizedTest`, or `@TestFactory` method in the current class; analogous to JUnit 4’s `@Before`. Such methods are *inherited* unless they are *overridden*. |
| `@AfterEach`             | Denotes that the annotated method should be executed *after* **each** `@Test`, `@RepeatedTest`, `@ParameterizedTest`, or `@TestFactory` method in the current class; analogous to JUnit 4’s `@After`. Such methods are *inherited* unless they are *overridden*. |
| `@BeforeAll`             | Denotes that the annotated method should be executed *before* **all** `@Test`, `@RepeatedTest`, `@ParameterizedTest`, and `@TestFactory` methods in the current class; analogous to JUnit 4’s `@BeforeClass`. Such methods are *inherited* (unless they are *hidden* or *overridden*) and must be `static` (unless the "per-class" [test instance lifecycle](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-test-instance-lifecycle) is used). |
| `@AfterAll`              | Denotes that the annotated method should be executed *after* **all** `@Test`, `@RepeatedTest`, `@ParameterizedTest`, and `@TestFactory` methods in the current class; analogous to JUnit 4’s `@AfterClass`. Such methods are *inherited* (unless they are *hidden* or *overridden*) and must be `static` (unless the "per-class" [test instance lifecycle](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-test-instance-lifecycle) is used). |
| `@Nested`                | Denotes that the annotated class is a non-static [nested test class](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-nested). `@BeforeAll` and `@AfterAll` methods cannot be used directly in a `@Nested` test class unless the "per-class" [test instance lifecycle](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-test-instance-lifecycle) is used. Such annotations are not *inherited*. |
| `@Tag`                   | Used to declare [tags for filtering tests](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-tagging-and-filtering), either at the class or method level; analogous to test groups in TestNG or Categories in JUnit 4. Such annotations are *inherited* at the class level but not at the method level. |
| `@Disabled`              | Used to [disable](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-disabling) a test class or test method; analogous to JUnit 4’s `@Ignore`. Such annotations are not *inherited*. |
| `@Timeout`               | Used to fail a test, test factory, test template, or lifecycle method if its execution exceeds a given duration. Such annotations are *inherited*. |
| `@ExtendWith`            | Used to [register extensions declaratively](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#extensions-registration-declarative). Such annotations are *inherited*. |
| `@RegisterExtension`     | Used to [register extensions programmatically](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#extensions-registration-programmatic) via fields. Such fields are *inherited* unless they are *shadowed*. |
| `@TempDir`               | Used to supply a [temporary directory](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-built-in-extensions-TempDirectory) via field injection or parameter injection in a lifecycle method or test method; located in the `org.junit.jupiter.api.io` package. |
